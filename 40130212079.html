        Benny was tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day o work.
        The exhausted type of tired where you're surprised your body can even
        move. All he wanted to do was sit in front of the TV, put his feet up on
        the coffee table, and drink a beer. The only issue was that he had
        forgotten where he lived.

          They decided to find the end of the rainbow. While they hoped they
          would find a pot of gold, neither of them truly believed that the
          mythical pot would actually be there. Nor did they believe they could
          actually find the end of the rainbow. Still, it seemed like a fun
          activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows would look
          great on their Instagram accounts. They would have never believed they
          would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they did, what they
          actually found there.
